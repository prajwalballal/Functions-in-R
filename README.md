# Functions-in-R
I have created a function which will take the dataset you have provided and will give you the t-test results of all the numerical feature with the binary target feature.  I have created a function that will only consider all the categorical variables from your data set and do a chi-square test for all categorical variables with your target variable.  I have created a function which when provided with a dataset will arrange all the features in the order of NUMERICAL, INTEGER, FACTOR, AND CHARACTER.
