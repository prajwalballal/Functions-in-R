# Functions-in-R
There are four functions I have created

1. Graphs_S4 :- This function that helps in doing EDA by easily differentiating all the numerical variables from the categorical variables and plot the graphs respectively.
2. t_Test:- I have created a function which will take the dataset you have provided and will give you the t-test results of all the numerical feature with the binary target                    feature.
3. chi_Sq_test:- I have created a function that will only consider all the categorical variables from your data set and do a chi-square test for all categorical variables with                       your target variable.
4. rearrange_variables:- I have created a function which when provided with a dataset will arrange all the features in the order of NUMERICAL, INTEGER, FACTOR, AND CHARACTER.
